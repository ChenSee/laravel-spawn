 * End-to-end response-framing test. Drives {@see tests/e2e/run_response_framing.php},
 * which boots a real TrueAsyncServer in a worker thread and reads raw responses off a
 * socket: what the answer announces as its length against what it carries, and whether
 * a body Symfony writes to standard output arrives at all.
 *
 * HttpE2ETest cannot cover this. Its fixture is DevServer, which emits through
 * ResponseEmitter and counts the body itself, so neither a mismatched length nor a lost
 * streamed body is expressible there.
 *
 * Run as its own process for the same reason as StreamingE2ETest: teardown sends SIGTERM
 * to the runner, which TrueAsyncServer answers with HttpServer::stop().
