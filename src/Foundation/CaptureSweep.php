 * nothing per-request does: Laravel builds `url`, the response factory and every
 * singleton middleware on the first request that needs them. Serving a request is
 * therefore part of the measurement, not a way of using the result — which is why this
 * exists beside {@see AsyncApplication::perRequestCaptures()} rather than inside it.
 *
 * Each URL runs in a scope of its own, the way a served request does, and the findings
 * are collected while that scope is still alive.
