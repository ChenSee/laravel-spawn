/**
 * A view factory whose render state belongs to the request instead of the worker.
 *
 * There is one factory per worker, as upstream intends: templates receive it as `$__env`,
 * `Component::$factory` caches it in a static, and `MailManager` and `Markdown` keep it in
 * their constructors. What moves per request is the state it writes while rendering —
 * `@section`, `@push`, the component and slot stacks, the nesting counter and the `@once`
 * ledger — because a render suspends whenever it touches the world: a composer queries the
 * database, a template reads a lazy relation, a template is compiled for the first time.
 * Shared, two responses write into one set of sections, and the nesting counter of one
 * render reaching zero empties the sections of the other in the middle of a page.
 *
 * The state moves without touching the framework methods that write it, of which there are
 * about fifty. The declared properties are removed from this object in the constructor, so
 * every read and write the inherited traits make falls through to `__get()` and `__set()`
 * and lands in a {@see BladeRenderState} taken from the request's context. `__get()`
 * returns by reference, which is what lets unmodified code run
 * `array_pop($this->sectionStack)` and `$this->pushes[$section][$key] .= $content`.
 *
 * Before bootCompleted(), and outside a request, one state held here answers instead: an
 * error page rendered during bootstrap, an artisan command and a test all keep working,
 * and nothing per-request is stored where the next request would inherit it.
